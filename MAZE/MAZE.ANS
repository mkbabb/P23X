DOCPH-0020 The program header format is adequate. 
DOCHB-0.00 Use of code blocks headers is not adequate, -10 points.     
           Programs must be broken into small functional blocks of code.     
           Each block must have a header that describes the code's function.

DOCLC-0.00 Use of line comments is not adequate, -10 points.                       
           Virtually all lines of executable code need a meaningful comment.

; Program:   nextval subroutine
;
; Function:  Find next mouse move in an array 15 by 30.
;            We can move into a position if its contents is blank ( 20h ).
;
; Input:     Calling sequence is:
;            x    pointer   si
;            y    pointer   di
;            dir  pointer   bx
