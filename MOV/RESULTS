DOCPH-0001 The program header is not adequate, -10 points.        
           Every program needs an descriptive program header.     
           See the Program Documentation Requirements on the WEB. 
DOCHB-0.15 Use of code blocks headers is not adequate, -10 points.     
           Programs must be broken into small functional blocks of code.     
           Each block must have a header that describes the code's function. 
           See the Program Documentation Requirements on the WEB.            
DOCLC-0.67 Use of line comments is not adequate, -10 points.                       
           Virtually all lines of executable code need a meaningful comment.

-> Calculating the total grade for the program.                  
This grade is subject to adjustment by the instructor.           
This grade will be reduced by any late submission penalty.
