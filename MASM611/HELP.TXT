
To download MASM follow these steps.

These instructions assume you will be using a directory C:\MASM611

If you are doing something different then you need to
- modify the process described
- modify the file new-vars.bat
For example if you are using your Eos account then that system uses the
k: drive and everywhere we have c: you need to change that to k:


1.  Make a directory on your computer named: masm611
    It must be off the root directory of your system.
    For example c:\masm611

2.  Go to the wrap directory.

3.  Click on the file masm611.exe

4.  Save that file in the c:\masm611 directory you created.

5.  Go to the c:\masm611 directory in a DOS box.

6.  Type: masm611 -d

7.  This will unpack all the files into the correct sub-directories.

8.  We will assume that you wish to do your development work in a directory 
    named c:\pc23x, so create that directory and change to that directory.

9.  Copy the file new-vars.bat from c:\masm611 to your pc23x working directory.
    You can use this DOS command:  copy  c:\masm611\new-vars.bat

10. Make sure that new-vars.bat refers to the correct disk drive.
    New-vars.bat assumes the directory with the tools is c:\masm611
    If that is not correct, you need to edit new-vars.bat so that it matches
    your system. If you are using Eos then change c: to k:

    Before you can use MASM you need to run the new-vars batch file.
    Type: new-vars.bat

    This will add the MASM directories into your path.
    You need to do this each time you want to use MASM,
    or you need to update your system to do it automatically.



This next section will test your installataion



*** Assemble, Link, and Run Sample "Hello World" Program ***

    1. Get MASM source code for the "Hello World" program.
       It is also in the wrap directory.

    2. Save hellom.asm file to your \pc23x directory

    3. Open a DOS window
       Go to your \pc23x directory
       If you have not already done so, type: new-vars.bat

    4. Assemble the source:
       ml /c /Zi /Fl hellom.asm

    5. Link the object file:
       link /CO hellom.obj

       You will be prompted for link options Just press the Enter key.

       Run File [hellom.exe]:
       List File [nul.map]:
       Libraries [.lib]:
       Definition File [nul.def]:

    6. To run the program, type: hellom



*** Possible Error Messages ***

    1. If you have **not** gotten new-vars correct then when you try to
       use MASM you will get an error message that looks like one of these.

          "Bad command or file name"

          "ML is not recognized as an internal or external command

       Make sure that new-vars.bat refers to the correct disk drive.
       New-vars.bat assumes the directory with the tools is c:\masm611
       If that is not correct, you need to edit new-vars.bat so that it matches
       your system. If you are using Eos then change c: to k:

       Before you can use MASM you need to run the new-vars batch file.

         Type: new-vars.bat

       This will add the MASM directories into your path.
       You need to do this **each** time you want to use MASM,
       or you need to update your system to do it automatically.


    2. If you get the error message "Out of environment space".

       Some information needed to run MASM is kept in a memory structure
       called the environment space.  If you exhaust this memory, you need
       to make it larger.  This will differ on every version of Windows.

       Here is one example from Windows XP.

       Create a shortcut to the MS-DOS Prompt on your desktop.
       Right click the mouse on the shortcut icon and then left click the mouse on Properties.
       Under "Target:" it will have %SystemRoot%\system32\cmd.exe 
       Add   /e:1024   to the end so it now looks like   %SystemRoot%\system32\cmd.exe /e:1024
       Click on okay



*** Other Possible Problems  ***

    1. If you are running TASM on an NT derivative of Windows (NT, 2000, XP)

       You must make a change to the file CONFIG.NT.  Add the
       following line to that file ...  actually it is probably there
       but has been converted to a comment by preceeding it with REM,
       so just remove the REM.

       REM   ntcmdprompt     (convert this)
             ntcmdprompt     (to this)

    2. The mouse does not work in a DOS box

       If you are using an NT derivative of Windows (NT, 2000, XP), then
       for the mouse to work under DOS, you must do either one of these:

       Turn off the Quick Edit Mode.

          Right click on blue title box of the DOS window.
          Select Properties.  Turn off the Quick Edit Mode

       Run DOS in full screen mode.

          Right click on blue title box of the DOS window.
          Select Properties.  Under Display Options select full screen.

    3. Do not use long path names. Paths are limited to 128 characters.
       Paths such as the one below will not work.

       C:\Users\DAL\Documents\School_Related\NCState\Classes\csc234-236\z_dev\HelloWorld
