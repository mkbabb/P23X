HW7 - Subroutines 

01.  You have been asked to review the following subroutine.  The       
calling program expects that all modified registers will be saved  
and restored.  Which registers are modified and should be saved    
and restored?                                                      
                                                                   
       sub:   mov  ax,[si]                                         
              add  [di],ax                                         
              mul  ax                                              
              mov  [bx],dx                                         
              ret                                                  
                                                                   
A. The only register  modified is:  ax                             
B. The only registers modified are: ax and si                      
C. The only registers modified are: ax and dx                      
D. The only registers modified are: ax and si and bx               
E. The only registers modified are: ax and di and bx               
F. The only registers modified are: ax and si and di and bx        


02.  The input to this routine is a pointer in si that points to a word of   
data in memory.  The routine is to swap the high byte and low byte of   
the data word in memory.  For example if si points the memory data word 
11 22, then the routine should set the memory data word to 22 11.   
                                                                    
      subr:   push  ax                                              
              push  si                                              
              mov   ax,[si]                                         
              mov   [si],ah                                         
              mov   [si+1],al                                       
              pop   si                                              
              pop   ax                                              
              ret                                                   
                                                                    
Which is true about the subroutine's operation.                     
A. The high and low bytes will be swapped for all values of the     
   memory data word.                                                
B. The high and low bytes will be swapped only if both bytes of     
   the memory data word are in the range of hex 00-7F.              
C. The high and low bytes will be swapped only if both bytes of     
   the memory data word are in the range of hex 80-FF.              
D. The high and low bytes will be swapped only if both bytes of     
   the memory data word have the same value.                        


03.  Given this subroutine whose input is a pointer in si.              
                                                                   
    subr:    mov  bx,2                                             
             mov  cx,1                                             
             mov  ax,[si]                                          
             mul  bx                                               
             jc   subret                                           
             div  cx                                               
    subret:  ret

E. None of the above will result in a divide overflow.             


04.  This subroutine has been written to determine if the unsigned             
word passed to it in ax is odd or even.  The specification is:            
    Input:  ax = unsigned word                                            
    Output: ax = 0 if input was even   ax = 1 if input was odd            
                                                                          
    oddeven:  mov  ah,2     ; set ah to 2 in preparation for the divide   
              div  ah       ; divide the low part of the input by 2 and   
                            ; the remainder in ah can only be 0 or 1      
              mov  al,ah    ; mov remainder to al (1=odd  0=even)         
              mov  ah,0     ; clear ah                                    
              ret           ; return                                      
                                                                          
Which statement is true about the subroutine                              
A. For all input values of ax it returns the correct output               
B. It never returns the correct output                                    
C. It returns the correct output only for inputs in the range 0 to 127    
D. It always returns ax set to 0                                          
E. It always returns ax set to 1

      subr:   push  ax                                              
              push  si                                              
              mov   ax,[si]                                         
              mov   [si],ah                                         
              mov   [si+1],al                                       
              pop   ax                                              
              pop   si
