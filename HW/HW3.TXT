HW3 - Basic Computer Architecture 

Questions 1-4 relate to a microprocessor with this instruction format.
   All instructions have two operands:
   - one is a register
   - the other is an absolute address of a memory variable
   This machine's memory is Byte Addressable.

The binary format of an instruction looks as follows:

   OOOOOOOOOLLRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Where....
 9 = O = number of bits in the opcode
 2 = L = number of bits that indicate the size of a data variable 
 3 = R = number of bits that indicate which register to use 
24 = A = number of bits that indicate the address of a byte in memory

*** GIVE ALL ANSWERS IN DECIMAL ***
01. How many unique OPCODES can this processor have.

02. How many different sizes of data can this processor allow.

03. How many registers does this processor have.

04. How many MegaBytes of memory can this processor address.

Questions 5-7 relate to a microprocessor with these characteristics.
   200 = clock speed in MegaHertz
     4 = the number of clock cycles required for each instruction

   Note that MegaHertz represents millions of cycles per second,
   1 Nano-second is 1 billionth of a second,
   MIPS stands for Million Instructions Per Second.

05. How many Nano-seconds does 1 clock cycle take to complete.

06. How many Nano-seconds does 1 instruction take to execute.

07. How many MIPS does this processor execute.
